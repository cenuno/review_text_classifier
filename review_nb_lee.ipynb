I had a nice view and everything I wanted was easily accessible. The room was spacious and properly furnished. I wish it was a little bit cheaper though, specially the in room dining which is super expensive. I also especially loved the lobby. It is simply gorgeous and takes my breath away.   \n",

We always try to stay at Fairmont properties while traveling. The Fairmont Olympic is a beautiful Hotel with Rich history. There is always one person at every Fairmont that makes you feel Special and right at home, for us it was Vincent. From the moment I we met Vincent he made us feel like family. Vincent's customer service is perfect in every way, and simply put he is the.reason we will return. I would highly recommend this hotel when in Seattle, and if a big fellow with a warm smile asks you if there is anything you need, you have found Vincent and you will be pleased you did.   \n",

Sumptuous comfortable bed, nicely decorated spacious room with comfortable furniture. Marble shower stall. Great aroma from the bath products. An incredibly comfortable and welcoming lobby, classic architecture, high ceilings... Staff that go above and beyond to remember your name hours after you meet them, and obviously care a lot about the guest experience.   \n",

Staff was courteous. Amenities were good. Food was not bad for in room dining.. only thing which i think can improve is the lighting inside the hotel.. Seattle isn't very bright outside, Having a dull environment inside hotel and in rooms isn't helping   \n",

They were the best!! Room was great. I love that they have a whole list of \"ij case you forgot\" items that you can get for free or borrow. Even though I only  came and went for work and then again for evening activities they all knew my name! Wine hour is also hard to beat. And they're dog friendly?! That's amazing!! Will totally look for Kimpton again.   \n",

Two things to be improved : hotel parking is a bit pricy ($42 + taxes ) and the room soundproofing. Overall it was great!   \n",

We expected a little bit more than we were promised on the phone, but the people working there quickly fixed our problem. The view is really nice considering you’re in the middle of downtown. The bathrooms are a little small, but the hotel rooms themselves is great.   \n",

I was always welcomed. Everyone was friendly. Have to kind of figure out where the entrance is because it's not too obvious. Clean hotel. Great products. Spacious rooms. My favorite touch was having an umbrella since i didnt pack mine.   \n",

The service was great at their restaurant and bar. Food was also wonderful at their Mediterranean restaurant.  Only  complaints are that the walls are so thin that we heard everything from other bedrooms and hallway. Also, the plumbing is old and we had to call for them to unplug the toilet. If it wasn't for that, I would have given this hotel 5 stars.   \n",

       "13   I was pleased that the staff allow us an early check in even though we didn't ask for it. We simply asked to have our bags stored until check in time we thank the hotel for that. \\n\\nWe understand the hotel is a older hotel and soundproofing was not a thing.  Be prepared for that.  It felt like I was watching my neighbors television and involved in their conversations.  \\n\\nThe restrooms are very dated and obviously small.  The bathtub needs reglazed the porcelain is chipping away around the drain.  \\n\\nThe things above are not complaints they are simple observations and understood due to the location being a historic hotel.\\n\\nWhat doesn't meet my expectations was the \\nconcierge.  This morning we waited nearly 10 minutes to speak to her about some advice but she was busy speaking to other guest about local politics and elected officials. I do not mind having this conversation if you don't have other guest waiting.  Thank goodness for Google.  It simply eliminated the need for her job today.   \n",

The bathroom was beautiful especially the bathtub. I loved the teddy bear and of course bought one :) staff was very friendly also. Will definitely stay again   \n",

Our server, Trey, was extremely helpful in making suggestions and checked back with us frequently to make sure we had everything we needed.   He gave us his full attention even though it was a Saturday night and the restaurant was busy.  The spaghetti and meatballs were delicious and so was the garlic bread, but it was really Trey's stellar service that made our meal special.   \n",

Parking was not bad and the area where we were seated was nice and secluded. The food was good but the service was pretty bad. From the time we were seated to the time we paid our check we had been there for 3 hours. We had 5 different servers asking the same questions right after one another. It took 30 minutes for our drinks to show up. We waited another long period of time for our check. When the check arrived there were extra items that we had to have removed. It took 3 attempts for them to get out check right.   \n",

Place was about 80% empty when we got there at 5:10pm on a Tuesday.  Tons of empty tables.  Once we said we didn't have a reservation, I could tell by their tone things were going down hill.  They could only give us the worst table in the middle of a walkway even though the entire back of the restaurant was empty, see photo, and the last time we came without a reservation we got a good table where we could hangout and relax.  We ate fast and went on to hang out somewhere else to spend our alcohol money.  When we left, almost no one filled the back tables, see second pic.  But at least their policy of only giving certain tables without a reservation was followed.  Those policies are what really count!!  Customer service should never come first, right??   \n",

I went here for my anniversary dinner and it was absolutely amazing. Our server, Chase, was very sweet and very accommodating. The only reason for 4 stars is because I picked crab shell out of my mouth when eating the crab topped deviled eggs. Other than that, it was absolutely spectacular and I would highly recommend.   \n",

I’d definitely go back. However, -1 star because the pricing was a little sneaky by charging a 5% service fee for employee wages. Draft beer also didn’t have a price on menu but was $9. That’s definitely not the normal price for a beer (even in Seattle) and is also a little dishonest.   \n",

The Loal 360 is proud to offer iconic breakfast and brunch items with ingredients from within a 360 mile radius. All the breakfast heavy hitters are on the menu,can be hard to make your choice.

Waitress Katya was very attentive and personable and very nice. Will definitely stop by again if I am ever back in Seattle. I wanted to order something different from what I am used to than in my hometown as there aren't any Irish restaurants there. I ordered the kidney pie, with one of their sausage dishes on the side. Both were surprisingly good, just because I didn't know what to expect.   \n",

Something about being haunted. (Of which I saw nothing)\\nAlso that it's the oldest Irish pub in seattle.\\n1. The food is excellent no question about it.\\n2. The service is spot on! My barmaid and the original owner were both abundantly kind to me. Took me on a tour. And chatted with me for my duration. Of which I I very grateful for such wonderful service and company. Along with getting personal introductions to the owners family. \\n3. It's a great place to just lounge. Welcoming atmosphere and just a natural sense of warmth that radiates through these old and new walls.\\nI personally an very glad I stepped foot in here. Thank you for a wonderful meal. Wonderful and charming company. And for having your doors open upon my arrival.\\nThank you so much! And best of luck with the upcoming business ventures!   \n",

My husband and I popped in for lunch and were not disappointed. It is very much reminiscent of pubs I've been to overseas as far as decor and ambience. The beer was great, and the food even better. The Irish stew and sausage roll tasted authentic, and the homemade bread was delightful. Service was outstanding. We will definitely be back many times in the future.   \n",

Grilled chicken burger was boring. The chicken tasted okay, but it wasn't seasoned. Burger bun was fresh and toasted. Fries were well done, extra crispy, as I asked. They were tasty, but the portion size was small. The salad was disappointing. The blue cheese dressing tasted like Marie's from a jar, and that's not a good thing; it had a vinegar taste.

       "1  We visited this Fairmont for two nights while in Seattle. We always try to stay at Fairmont properties while traveling. The Fairmont Olympic is a beautiful Hotel with Rich history. There is always one person at every Fairmont that makes you feel Special and right at home, for us it was Vincent. From the moment I we met Vincent he made us feel like family. Vincent's customer service is perfect in every way, and simply put he is the.reason we will return. I would highly recommend this hotel when in Seattle, and if a big fellow with a warm smile asks you if there is anything you need, you have found Vincent and you will be pleased you did.   \n",
